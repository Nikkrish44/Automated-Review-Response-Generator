# AI-Powered Customer Feedback Responder
This project is a Python-based AI service that can:
- Analyze customer feedback to determine sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative)
- Extract key themes from customer reviews
- Generate professional email responses based on sentiment and themes
- Send the generated responses to customers via email using SMTP

Future improvements include integrating a real database of customer reviews through an API endpoint.
